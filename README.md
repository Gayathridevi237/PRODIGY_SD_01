# PRODIGY_SD_01


PRODIGY INFOTECH INTERNSHIP TASK 1

A program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales.


This program converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. It prompts the user to input a temperature value and the original unit of measurement,
and then converts the temperature to the other two units, displaying the converted values to the user.

FEATURES USED ARE :

User-Friendly GUI: Built with Tkinter, the program offers a clean and simple interface. 
-Multiple Conversions: Convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. 
-Real-Time Results: Immediate conversion results upon input. 
-Error Handling: Validates user input to ensure accurate conversions.

INSTALL :

Step 1: Choose a Programming Language

The Temperature Conversion Program can be written in various programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, etc. 
For this example, let's choose Python as the programming language.

Step 2: Install Python

If you don't have Python installed on your computer, you can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Step 3: Create a New Python File

Create a new file with a .py extension, for example, PRODIGY_SD_01.py.

Step 4: WRITE T the Code

Step 5: Run the Program

Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, 
and run the program using the following command:

Step 6: Use the Program

Follow the prompts to enter a temperature value and the original unit of measurement.
The program will convert the temperature to the other two units and display the results.

That's it! You have successfully installed and run the Temperature Conversion Program.

CONCEPTS LEARNED IN THIS :



Here are the concepts learned in this Temperature Conversion Program:

1. Functions: * Defining and calling functions to perform specific tasks (e.g., celsius_to_fahrenheit, fahrenheit_to_celsius, etc.).
2.  * Understanding function arguments and return values.

3. Conditional Statements: * Using if-elif-else statements to handle different conditions based on user input (e.g., checking the original unit of measurement). * Understanding the logic behind conditional statements and how they control the program's flow.

4. Input/Output Operations: * Using input() function to get user input (e.g., temperature value and original unit). * Using print() function to display output to the user (e.g., converted temperatures).

5. Data Types: * Understanding the difference between integer and floating-point numbers (e.g., using float() to convert user input to a floating-point number). * Using string data type to store and manipulate text (e.g., original unit of measurement).

6. String Manipulation: * Using string methods (e.g., upper()) to manipulate and validate user input. * Understanding how to concatenate strings using the + operator.

7. Mathematical Operations: * Performing arithmetic operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to convert temperatures between units. * Understanding the order of operations (PEMDAS) and how to use parentheses to group expressions.

8. Program Structure: * Organizing code into a logical structure using functions and conditional statements. * Understanding the importance of indentation and whitespace in Python.

9. User Interaction: * Designing a user-friendly interface to interact with the program. * Understanding how to provide feedback to the user through output messages.
